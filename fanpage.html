            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Princess Nokia was born in New York City in 1992. She started her music career early as a club kid. At 16 she was hosting parties and go-go dancing. At this time she built relationships with other artists and eventually she started an all female collective by the name of Smart Girl Club.

            <p>In 2015, she embraced the moniker, Princess Nokia. She explains in an interview with Bullet Magazine,
            </p>

            <p><em>As Princess Nokia I can project the multi-dimensional aspects of myself that I could not express with the name Wavy Spice. I can venture into any realm of music or character of my choosing without confusion. I’m making worldly music—music that will talk to all kinds of people. Banjee girls in Harlem, teen brides in the Middle East, gay boys in East Asia. Labels no longer matter. My new music is cosmic and three-dimensional, and it will really speak of who Princess Nokia is. Princess Nokia is sound. It is progression. It is all that I am.
